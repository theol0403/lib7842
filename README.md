# lib7842

lib7842 is a collection of powerful utilities and motion algorithms for VEX V5
robots. Designed to be used with the [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/)
framework, it builds on top of the
[OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib) library.

lib7842 was in development during my time on the
[7842F/B](https://theol0403.github.io/7842B-Journal/) robotics team between
2018-2021.

This is released as-is, with little documentation (other than the source code)
and no support. It is made public to add to my portfolio and to help inspire
other teams on what is possible. It is not recommended trying to directly use,
as there is no support but also no learning benefit from copy/pasting the code.

All source code is located in `/include/lib7842/` and `/src/lib7842/`.

## Demo

Some parts of the library, especially the odometry and trajectory generation,
are documented in my [journal](https://theol0403.github.io/7842B-Journal/).

Example usage of the library, and what is possible using an autonomous routine,
is available in my
[change up competition code](https://github.com/theol0403/7842B-Change-Up).

    actions

### Path Following

- Comprehensive path representation library
  ([`api/positioning/spline`](https://github.com/theol0403/lib7842/tree/develop/include/lib7842/api/positioning/spline))
  - Arcs, n-th degree BÃ©zier curves, Hermite splines, arc meshing, and more
  - Full constexpr compile-time sampling support

### Trajectory Generation

- [Introduction](https://theol0403.github.io/7842B-Journal/2020-06-01/introduction/)

  | [Python Implementation](https://github.com/theol0403/python-profile)
- 1D Trapezoidal Motion Profile, parameterized for distance, supporting
  piecewise velocity waypoints
  ([`api/trajectory/profile`](https://github.com/theol0403/lib7842/tree/develop/include/lib7842/api/trajectory/profile))
- Skid-steer open-loop trajectory generation
  ([`trajectory/skidGenerator`](https://github.com/theol0403/lib7842/blob/develop/include/lib7842/api/trajectory/generator/skidGenerator.hpp)),
  with high-speed computation and oversaturation protection.
- X-drive open-loop trajectory generation
  ([`trajectory/xGenerator`](https://github.com/theol0403/lib7842/blob/develop/include/lib7842/api/trajectory/generator/xGenerator.hpp)),
  with arbitrary heading profiling and waypoints
  - supports following the trajectory like a skid-steer (at an arbitrary start
    heading), or rotating while driving

## Architecture

- Built on top of OkapiLib device abstractions, so is platform-agnostic
- Can be built on PC using OkapiLib mocking library
- LVGL GUI library can be developed on PC
- Unit tests written for most components using `doctest`
  - Tests are included in class source files
  - Tests are run both in CI but also on `debug` deployments on the V5
- Use git flow for development
